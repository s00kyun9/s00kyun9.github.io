            <h2>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
            <p>The first thing that caught my attention was the clean typography and well-organized layout. The harmony between font sizes, spacing, and alignment created a sense of balance that made the entire portfolio easy to read and visually appealing. The layout was flawless — everything felt perfectly placed without any distractions or clutter. This thoughtful design immediately drew me in and allowed me to focus on the content with ease. It gave a strong first impression of the artist’s refined aesthetic and made the experience feel immersive from the very beginning.</p>

            <p>I spent the most time on the portfolio page.
              Each project was presented with minimal text and strong visuals, which encouraged exploration.
              The hover animations and smooth transitions between projects made it enjoyable to browse through multiple works and clearly conveyed the artist’s aesthetic.</p>

I especially enjoyed playing with the interactive stickers inside each box — they were fun to move around, so I kept trying them multiple times.
