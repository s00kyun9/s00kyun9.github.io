        Below are heartfelt digital letters created by real users within this web space. Each letter is a reflection of their thoughts and feelings — carefully written, emotionally decorated, and sealed with care.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        At the beginning of this project, I focused heavily on visual aesthetics. However, as the process unfolded, I came to realize that emotional storytelling, immersive pacing, and the rhythm of sentiment were even more important.
        While I considered features like real-time preview or functional expansion, I ultimately chose to limit features and preserve the emotional flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, through this project, I identified some technical limitations and user experience gaps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Users were not clearly informed about how to resize or rotate stickers, leading to confusion with the shortcut-based controls.</li>
        <li>In some browser environments, flickering or residual traces appeared when stickers were moved.</li>
        <li>The absence of a soft ‘undo’ function after submission resulted in users losing all content upon accidentally navigating away.</li>
        <li>The 450-character limit sometimes made it difficult to fully express emotional messages.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite these challenges, I learned that even a simple web interaction can leave a strong impression when guided by emotional design and clear intent.
        Designing for emotional experiences — not just functionality — is a philosophy I will carry into future projects.
        In the next steps, I hope to address the usability concerns and improve the emotional clarity of the interaction even further.
